    let age = 100;
    let age_copy = age;
    console.log(age, age_copy);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age_copy);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Leona', 'Vayne', 'Ryze', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Jax';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newTeam = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newTeam_2 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newTeam_ES6 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    newTeam_ES6[1] = 'Nautilus'
    console.log(players, newTeam_ES6);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const center = {
      name: 'Nikola Jokic',
      age: 100
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const shootingGuard = center;
    shootingGuard.name = 'James Harden'
    console.log(center,shootingGuard);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const pointGuard = Object.assign({}, center, { age: 200 });
    console.log(center, pointGuard);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const rookie = {...center};

    // Hacky: Using JSON
    const coach = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(center));
